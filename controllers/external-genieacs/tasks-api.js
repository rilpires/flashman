/* Get all tasks, in GenieACS, for a device, remove unnecessary tasks, join
 tasks that could have been issue together and add a new given task for a given
 device id and returns an array in which the first position is an error
 message, when there is any, or null where there is none, and in the second
 position, a true value if the new task is executed under 'timeout' or null if
 it will emit the result through socket.io. Possible returns:
- [msg !== null, null]: error.
- [msg === null, null]: result will be given using socket.io.
- [msg === null, true]: task executed successfully before 'timeout' run out.

Arguments:
'deviceid' is a string identifying a device in GenieACS database.
'task' is an object which structure is a Genie task with its parameters already
 set. refer to https://github.com/genieacs/genieacs/wiki/API-Reference#tasks.
'timeout' is a number in milliseconds that will be used as request timeout when
 communicating with GenieACS.
'shouldRequestConnection' is a boolean that tells GenieACS to initiate a
 connection to the CPE and execute the task. When it's false, genie will
 always return as fast as possible saying task was scheduled for later.
'watchTimes' is an array of numbers that are the milliseconds used for waiting
 for scheduled tasks to disappear from GenieACS database, used only if the
 request 'timeout', sent to genie, runs out without an answer confirm the task
 execution.
'callback' is a callback to override the default behaviour of calling the sio
 event handler
Having 2 or more numbers in this array means one or more retries to genie, for
 the cases when genie can't retry a task on its own. After all retries sent to
 genie, if the retried task doesn't disappear from its database, a message
 saying the task has not executed is emitted through socket.io.*/
